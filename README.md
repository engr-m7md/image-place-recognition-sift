Image-Based Place Recognition using SIFT



This project is a Python-based web application built with Flask and OpenCV that performs place recognition from images using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm.



The system allows users to upload an image, extracts distinctive feature points using SIFT, and then matches these features against a predefined image database to identify the most likely location.



* Features



Image upload via a simple Flask web interface

Feature extraction using SIFT keypoints and descriptors

Feature matching against a stored image database

Robust recognition under scale, rotation, and lighting changes

Fast and accurate location identification





* Technologies Used



Python.

Flask – web framework.

OpenCV – computer vision processing.

SIFT Algorithm – feature detection and description.





* How It Works

The user uploads an image through the web interface.

SIFT is used to detect keypoints and extract descriptors from the image.

Extracted features are compared with stored descriptors in the database.

The system finds the best match and identifies the corresponding place.







* Use Cases

Landmark recognition

Image-based location identification

Computer vision research and learning

Feature matching demonstrations





* Notes

This project focuses on classical computer vision techniques rather than deep learning.

SIFT provides strong performance for feature-based image matching tasks.
